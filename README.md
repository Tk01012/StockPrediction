# StockPrediction

## Project Overview
Welcome to the StockPrediction project! In this endeavor, our main objective is to predict the price of the S&P500 stock market index. Through a series of well-defined steps and machine learning techniques, we aim to create an accurate prediction model that can provide valuable insights into the market's behavior.

## Project Steps
To achieve our goal, we will be following these essential steps:

1. **Data Acquisition:** We will utilize the powerful `yfinance` package to download the required data. This step is crucial as accurate and reliable data forms the foundation of any successful prediction model.

2. **Initial Model Creation:** Our first step into the realm of machine learning involves building an initial model. We will train this model using the acquired data and evaluate its accuracy to establish a baseline performance metric.

3. **Backtesting Engine Development:** Accuracy is a multifaceted concept, and we want to ensure our model performs consistently well. To achieve this, we will construct a robust backtesting engine. This engine will provide a more comprehensive assessment of our model's capabilities.

4. **Model Refinement:** Armed with the insights gained from the backtesting engine, we will endeavor to enhance the accuracy of our model. This step might involve experimenting with different algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
